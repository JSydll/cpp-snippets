# cpp-snippets

In the snippets.md file, you'll find a collection of C++ snippets for recurring functionalities like 
filesystem operations or interacting with a Linux system. 

It should be updated as soon as a better implementation is found.  

If you have comments on the snippets or want to contribute, feel free to contact me at joschka[at]seydell.org.
